# Welcome to my github!
My name is Tracey. Feel free to take a look around!

Please note that this is my PUBLIC github. I have a second private github (used much more frequently) under a pseudonym for privacy reasons. The "daily contributions" on this account is in no way indicative of my actual coding activities, so I ask that you please do not rely on that information.
Due to privacy,safety, etc. concerns I do not feel comfortable sharing details about my private account or projects. Thank you for your understanding.

## Note: On vacation/hiatus for late March, all of April, and early May. I will update some projects sporadically during that time, but my internet access will be limited. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.
