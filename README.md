# A foreword
I highly suggest checking out the [cookie recipe](https://github.com/sterlingphoenix/ChocolateChipCookies) that a certain someone special shared with me back when he was trying to "impress me". His words, not mine!\
They're pretty good. I can't take credit for the recipe but I will take credit for planting the idea in his head to push it to github so we could track changes.

# Tracey's Github

My name is Tracey (she/her). I am also known online by the monikers Bisharp/b1sharp. I am 25 years old. Feel free to take a look around!

I am the co-founder (referred to as the Leader) of an organization known as The Boomerang Team, founded in 2008. The organization's mission is a secret, but has remained unchanged since its founding. Recruitment for The Boomerang Team is currently closed.

You may also know me from my social media accounts, which have reached a total of over 30k followers across all platforms. Professionally, I currently work in social media management for a local nonprofit, creating content for 8 different social media accounts.

My tech experience:

I first learned to code on Neopets back in 2007, and then Scratch in 2009. I made my first website, theboomerangteam.com (now defunct) at 9 years old. My first 'summer job' was at the age of 14, setting up several Mac computer labs, replacing RAM, troubleshooting, etc.\
I have a year of IT experience. You can learn more from my LinkedIn/resume. My specialty is systems administration (primarily Linux), but I also have modern web development experience (React/node.js/express/postgreSQL). I am always open to new experiences.\
Outside of programming, I am a multidisciplinary artist, author and comedian. I have written and illustrated several comic books. I continue to write under the "b1sharp" name. I frequently post my writings on social media.\
Scratch username: t_rangerscool (A lot of older projects have been removed for privacy reasons)
