# Welcome to my github!
My name is Tracey (she/her). I am 24 years old. Feel free to take a look around!
I first learned to code on Neopets back in 2007, and then Scratch in 2009. 
I made my first website at 9 years old. 
My first 'summer job' was at the age of 14, setting up several Mac computer labs, replacing RAM, troubleshooting, etc.
I have a year of IT experience. You can learn more from my LinkedIn/resume.
My specialty is web development (React/node.js/express/postgreSQL), but I am always open to new experiences.

Outside of programming, I am an artist and author. I have written and illustrated several comic books.
