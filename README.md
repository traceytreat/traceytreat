# Welcome to my github!
My name is Tracey (she/her). I am 24 years old. Feel free to take a look around!

I first learned to code on Neopets back in 2007, and then Scratch in 2009. 

I made my first website at 9 years old. 

My first 'summer job' was at the age of 14, setting up several Mac computer labs, replacing RAM, troubleshooting, etc.

I have a year of IT experience. You can learn more from my LinkedIn/resume.

My specialty is web development (React/node.js/express/postgreSQL), but I am always open to new experiences.

Outside of programming, I am an artist and author. I have written and illustrated several comic books.

As both an artist and programmer I have my own views on AI. Although I do see the merits of AI, I am firmly against art theft; this includes the usage of creators' work (drawings, voice, etc.) to train AI models without permission. I refuse to work on any project in which I will be stealing from others. Many people harmed by these technologies come from marginalized groups. It saddens me to see how others completely disregard ethics and empathy for others in order to pursue profits.
